<h3 align="center"> Overview </h3>

**Crops & Flesh** is a top-down pixel art survival RPG, developed as part of an academic game project, that blends cozy farming gameplay with light horror, and dark comedy. The game places the player in a quiet rural environment where daily routines such as farming, crafting, and eating are slowly disrupted by hoards of enemies.

The core experience focuses on survival under pressure, where every action, what to grow, what to eat, and how to process resources, has long-term consequences. The contrast between peaceful farm life and escalating danger is central to the game’s identity.
